[ESGHELP]

esgWhatIs= "While not visible to the player, behind the scenes Skyrim has 31 equipment slots that armor can be assigned to (They are numbered 30-61).Vanilla Skyrim only uses a few of these slots. As an example boots go in slots 37, chest armor goes in 32, and helmet goes in 30. Many of the slots are not used by basic Skyrim but modders that make equipment do use them. There's no real standard amongst the community for what these slots should be used for. As an example one equipment modder might put glasses in slot 46 another might put pants in that slot, the player can only equip one item per slot at a time. ESG stands for Equipment Slot Groups and is a way for the player to define what types of clothing the different slots are so OSA can be aware of exactly what characters are wearing, and playing dynamic exact animations for those pieces."

esgHowDo= "To set up ESG you must identify what slots your installed armor is using. You can accomplish this by viewing your equipment in any of the OSA menu's designed to show what characters are wearing. You'll see that each item is numbered with it's correlating slot. As an example if what you have equipped in that slot is a pair of stockings, you'd then assign that slot the STOCKINGS esg. ESG must be defined per gender and you'll see in this set of menus an option to configer either the Male or Female's ESG. You can also set up Exclusions which omit that slot from being removed by QuickUndress (Primarily used for Wigs, Anatomy, and Physics Objects). ESG will not be able to handle armor of the same type using different slots, for example if you have 2 different pants mods installed and one author uses slot 46 and the other 54. In this case it's up to the user to find armor mods that share slots or to learn how to edit the armor in the CK to conform them to a single slot."
